Description
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, this is one of many skill building projects I'll upload to GitHub to keep track of what I've learned, things I could improve upon, and other things. Some of these projects in the "Skill Building" category are either public or private, really depends.
    
Either way, if you manage to view this project keep in mind I'm still fairly new in the world of coding (despite HTML/CSS not being programming languages) I'm still getting a hang of stuff works. Feel free to download, comment, whatever, I don't know how GitHub works.

Thanks, Marz
